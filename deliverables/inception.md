## 1. Introduction

The concept of the project is to make a website that hosts and displays the capstone projects (and other similar projects) for the Math and Stats department (focused on the data science program specifically) as there is no current system for this. It is meant to create a theater for students, faculty, and interested third parties to view past and present projects. It will have a database backend to contain relevant contents of each project and a front end webpage focused on navigation to search and view the projects. 


## 2. Initial value proposition and customer segments

We help the Math and Statistics Department at NAU keep track and display capstone and similar projects by making a repository that features a web interface focused on being accessible for users and contributors that are generally academics without web development experience. 


## 3. Interviews summary
Present the results of each interview (the minimum number of interviews is 1.5 * the number of participants in the group).

For each interview, report:

Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview
When
Customer segment
Key insights from the interview
Representative quotes
Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Donâ€™t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
Grading criteria (15 points): You should have at least the required number of interviews. For each interview, you should report the required information. The insight should be grounded on the interview and illustrated by the representative quotes.

### Interview 1
B.S. Data Science student
2/1/2025

1. Can you describe your experience with student research in the Mathematics & Statistics
department?
I personally have not done any formal student research for the department.
3. How do you currently access or showcase research projects and presentations?
GitHub was commonly used throughout my academic programs if there was a need for a digital hub, and I use it to host project for my resume. Although that was rarely needed has teacher just used the canvas environment.
4. What difficulties do you face when finding past research or colloquia?
Honestly, in B.S. DS area of the school I can not recall a time in the pasts years where I have been told about where past student research/projects are held.
5. If a research showcase website existed, how likely would you be to use it? Why or why not?
I might not have needed it my first 2 years of school but I would've found it very helpful when preparing for upperclassman projects and our capstone. Seeing others work and the type of professionalism that a students can achieve would be beneficial to my education.
6. What features would be most valuable to you
A clean environment and easy access to student capstone projects/or research.

7. Have you ever tried to showcase your research online? If so, where?
I have only ever upload projects to Github
8. Would you want a dedicated portfolio for your research projects? Why or why not?
Yes, if that was integrated into the BS DS program I think it would highly benefit every student.
9. What would make submitting your research to a public repository easy or difficult?
An easy upload system.
10. Would this help when applying for jobs, internships, or graduate school?
Yes, we could easily link this to our resume and showcase what we have done during our academic journey.
11. Would you be more likely to submit research if the faculty approved it first?
Yes, one hundred percent. I know there are a lot of politics that your have to deal within that area.


### Interview 2
Dr. Robert Buscaglia
1/31/2025

1. Can you describe your experience with student research in the Mathematics & Statistics department?
I love student research and often helps students in that area. 

2. How do you currently access or showcase research projects and presentations?
Currently BS DS capstone projects are not hosted online but are some are hung up in Adel. Some research is online at the undergraduate symposia website. 

3. What difficulties do you face when finding past research or colloquia?
There is not a dedicated place for past research and colloquia for the department.

4. If a research showcase website existed, how likely would you be to use it? Why or why not?
Dr. B stated much enthusiasm for the idea and brought it up to the department to ask for their opinions on the topic. He's Going to get back to us with their comments. 

5. What features would be most valuable to you?
Different types of media available to upload was his biggest ask. 

6. Do you reference past student projects when advising new students? If so, how do you find them?
Yes, one of the first assignments in the BS DS Capstone is to look at past projects.

7. Would you find it helpful to have a structured, department-wide research archive?
As stated earlier Dr. B emphasized his enthusiasm for the project and is going to help us throughout the semester to make this idea come to light. 

8. What level of oversight would you want for research submissions?
He didn't comment too much on this but stated again the need for multiple media formats. 

9. Would you be willing to approve or curate student submissions?
Dr. B stated this could be possible but it would be up to the department.

### Interview 3: 

Igor Steinmacher by Rylan Harris via email
January 31

1. What is your role in the department?
    I am currently an assistant professor, responsible for the CS Capstone projects

2. How do you interact with student research and projects?
    This can be a long conversation, depending on what you want to know. I work with a few students on research (outside of the capstone context), in the capstone projects, I work more on the organization and problem-resolution side. I interact with potential clients to get proposals from people in industry and academia. We work together to come up with interesting projects for the students. Then, I pitch the projects to the students, who bid on them. Then, I assign teams to the proposals. My interface from the moment the projects are assigned on is with the team mentors (GTAs who manage the teams). I work on the backstage, guaranteeing that the projects are moving forward, and I teach the lectures on topics that are important to the teams during the semester.

3. How do you interface with the website or update it with new projects?
    I use SFTP and manually update the projects and HTML using a text editor.

4. What challenges do you face with the existing system?
    Well... there is no actual system haha. So, anything that could be updateable directly via web interface would be amazing. Like, every semester there is a ton of renaming, creating folders, archiving, etc. to guarantee that we keep the history.

5. Are there any concerns about submitting or accessing research on the site?
    I did not understand the questions, I think. I think the previous answer may somehow cover this question.

6. Are there any changes you'd like to see in the existing system?
    Again, there is no system ðŸ˜‰

7. What are the most important features as an administrator?
    It would be great to have such a system to enable creating new semesters, automatically updating the pages, having a way to upload the proposals and move away from the FTP and text editors.

8. What level of oversight would you want for research submissions? Do you want direct control, or would you prefer a submission-approval method?
    If we are talking about the proposals from the community: Submission approval is the way to go (with interaction with the submitters)for us because we have multiple rounds of polishing and adjusting to have a final version of the proposals aligned with our goals (it is an iterative and incremental approach).

The customer segment I'm targetting here is those that act as administrators/maintenance for the website. Clearly, some of my questions were a bit confusing but the core of the feedback that I took away is that he would like to have a web interface so that he doesn't have to manually manage the projects and add them into the html. It also appeared that having an avenue for interested third party sponsors to reach out would be helpful as well. Though he the knowledge to edit the website himself, he still voiced interest in having a web interface to improve ease of use. Because they already have a similar website, our solution would be a "nice to have" for the added accessibility.

## 4. Final value proposition and consumer segments
