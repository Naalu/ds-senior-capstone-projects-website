## 2. Retrospective

1. **Appreciations:** Jack for getting to work early and keeping us ahead of schedule.
2. **Successes:** The team really came together well to complete the Deliverable once we were able to.
3. **Failures:** Some miscommunication this week led to redundant work being done.
4. **Barriers:** Not meeting in person (only online this week) probably resulted in more communication failures than has been typical.
5. **What we should try next time:** Getting together for an synchronous collaboration worked well and should be looked at for future development.
