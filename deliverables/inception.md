## 1. Introduction

The concept of the project is to make a website that hosts and displays the capstone projects (and other similar projects) for the Math and Stats department (focused on the data science program specifically) as there is no current system for this. It is meant to create a theater for students, faculty, and interested third parties to view past and present projects. It will have a database backend to contain relevant contents of each project and a front end webpage focused on navigation to search and view the projects. 


## 2. Initial value proposition and customer segments

We help the Math and Statistics Department at NAU keep track and display capstone and similar projects by making a repository that features a web interface focused on being accessible for users and contributors that are generally academics without web development experience. 


## 3. Interviews summary
Present the results of each interview (the minimum number of interviews is 1.5 * the number of participants in the group).

For each interview, report:

Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview
When
Customer segment
Key insights from the interview
Representative quotes
Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Donâ€™t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
Grading criteria (15 points): You should have at least the required number of interviews. For each interview, you should report the required information. The insight should be grounded on the interview and illustrated by the representative quotes.


## 4. Final value proposition and consumer segments
Report the refined versions of these elements (the ones that you reached after the interviews).

Grading criteria (5 points): There must be a connection between the key insights of the interviews and the refinement of the value proposition and customer segments previously presented. See also criteria for Section 2 of this document.
Format

Your document should be composed in Markdown and hosted on GitHub but you should also turn in a PDF copy to be graded. See also Converting GitHub Markdown to PDF. Sections should use appropriate markdown and figures should be included if needed or appropriate.
Additional grading criteria

Your deliverable should have all the aforementioned sections. The document should be written in an appropriate language. The format should be as described above. You should host the document on your GitHub repository and you should use pull requests to update it. Penalties will be applied for not following these instructions.
