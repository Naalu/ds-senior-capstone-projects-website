## 5. Project Idea

### Project Description

The "Senior Capstone Projects Website" will create a centralized platform for showcasing the capstone projects of NAU's Department of Mathematics and Statistics. This user-friendly and maintainable website will highlight student achievements and serve as a resource for current and prospective students, faculty, and the broader NAU community.

### Target Audience

- **Current Students**: Gain inspiration and reference previous projects.
- **Faculty and Advisors**: Showcase department achievements and track outcomes.
- **Prospective Students**: Learn about the departmentâ€™s focus areas and opportunities.
- **NAU Community and General Public**: Enhance visibility of department initiatives.

### Features and Functionalities

- **Project Listings**:
  - Organized by year, team, or theme.
  - Includes project details, abstracts, team members, and faculty advisors.
  - Links to documents and resources (e.g., GitHub repos, presentations).
- **Search and Filter Options**: By keyword, department, year, or topic.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Administrative Panel**: Allows staff to manage project entries.
- **Future Scalability**: Designed for integration with additional departments.

### Initial Technology Stack

The project will focus on Python for both frontend and backend development to ensure consistency and streamline the development process. The proposed stack includes:

- **Frontend**: Python-based frameworks like Flask or Django (for templating) with CSS/HTML for styling. Optionally, tools like Jinja2 for dynamic content generation.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask or Django to handle routing, logic, and API integration.
- **Database**: SQLite for initial development, with the flexibility to migrate to PostgreSQL for production.
- **Development Environment**: Python IDEs (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm), Git/GitHub for version control.
- **Hosting**: A Python-friendly platform such as Heroku, PythonAnywhere, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - **Pandas** for any tabular data processing.
  - **Flask-WTF** for forms.
  - **Plotly** or **Matplotlib** for potential data visualizations.

This approach will enable the team to focus on software engineering principles without splitting effort across multiple languages or ecosystems.
