## Executive Summary

This was a rough week for the team. We had multiple members out sick and away,which slowed down our progress.
We did manage to get some work done, but we are now a little behind schedule.
We need to make up for lost time next week.
We will be meeting on Monday to discuss our progress and make a plan for the coming week.

## 1. Activity Summary

Rylan drove much of the progress.  Most of the team was out sick or away, so we did not make as much progress as we had hoped.
We discussed our project after having done interviews and in light of the *new-to-us* use cases.
We also discussed what a minimum viable product (MVP) would look like for our project.
Finally, we discussed the need to identify and document the core features of our project that we will need to implement first.
Not much activity on GitHub this week, but a clearer picture of the project is emerging.

- Completed the last remaining outstanding interview.
- Worked on the UML diagrams for our different user types.
