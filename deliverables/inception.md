## 1. Introduction

The Mathematics & Statistics Research Showcase is a centralized platform designed to host and display student capstone research, undergraduate projects, and colloquium presentations. Currently, there is no single, well-organized system for tracking and sharing past research, which makes it difficult for students to showcase their work, for faculty to reference previous projects, and for external audiences (graduate schools, employers, prospective students) to evaluate research output.

Our goal is to create a user-friendly platform with a **Python and SQL** backend that enables seamless research submission, searchability, and accessibility. This project will provide students with an academic portfolio, faculty with an organized archive, and external users with an easy way to browse research output.

## 2. Initial value proposition and customer segments

We help the Mathematics & Statistics Department at NAU keep track of and display student research projects by providing a structured, web-accessible repository. The platform is designed for users who may not have web development experience but need an easy way to contribute and explore academic content.

### Customer Segments

1. **Students** – Showcase research, build academic portfolios, and gain visibility.
2. **Faculty** – Archive and reference student research while maintaining oversight.
3. **External Visitors** – Employers, graduate programs, and prospective students exploring research at NAU.

### Interview 1

B.S. Data Science Student by Ethan

2/1/2025

1. Can you describe your experience with student research in the Mathematics & Statistics department?

*I personally have not done any formal student research for the department.*

2. How do you currently access or showcase research projects and presentations?

*GitHub was commonly used throughout my academic programs if there was a need for a digital hub, and I use it to host project for my resume. Although that was rarely needed has teacher just used the canvas environment.*

3. What difficulties do you face when finding past research or colloquia?

*Honestly, in B.S. DS area of the school I can not recall a time in the pasts years where I have been told about where past student research/projects are held.*

4. If a research showcase website existed, how likely would you be to use it? Why or why not?

*I might not have needed it my first two years of school but I would've found it very helpful when preparing for upperclassman projects and our capstone. Seeing others work and the type of professionalism that a students can achieve would be beneficial to my education.*

5. What features would be most valuable to you?

*A clean environment and easy access to student capstone projects/or research.*

6. Have you ever tried to showcase your research online? If so, where?

*I have only ever upload projects to Github.*

7. Would you want a dedicated portfolio for your research projects? Why or why not?

*Yes, if that was integrated into the BS DS program I think it would highly benefit every student.*

8. What would make submitting your research to a public repository easy or difficult?

*An easy upload system.*

9. Would this help when applying for jobs, internships, or graduate school?

*Yes, we could easily link this to our resume and showcase what we have done during our academic journey.*

10. Would you be more likely to submit research if the faculty approved it first?

*Yes, one hundred percent. I know there are a lot of politics that your have to deal within that area.*

### Interview 3

Igor Steinmacher by Rylan via email 1/31/2025

1. What is your role in the department?

*I am currently an assistant professor, responsible for the CS Capstone projects.*

2. How do you interact with student research and projects?

*This can be a long conversation, depending on what you want to know. I work with a few students on research (outside of the capstone context), in the capstone projects, I work more on the organization and problem-resolution side. I interact with potential clients to get proposals from people in industry and academia. We work together to come up with interesting projects for the students. Then, I pitch the projects to the students, who bid on them. Then, I assign teams to the proposals. My interface from the moment the projects are assigned on is with the team mentors (GTAs who manage the teams). I work on the backstage, guaranteeing that the projects are moving forward, and I teach the lectures on topics that are important to the teams during the semester.*

3. How do you interface with the website or update it with new projects?

*I use SFTP and manually update the projects and HTML using a text editor.*

4. What challenges do you face with the existing system?

*Well... there is no actual system haha. So, anything that could be update-able directly via web interface would be amazing. Like, every semester there is a ton of renaming, creating folders, archiving, etc. to guarantee that we keep the history.*

5. Are there any concerns about submitting or accessing research on the site?

*I did not understand the questions, I think. I think the previous answer may somehow cover this question.*

6. Are there any changes you'd like to see in the existing system?

*Again, there is no system* 😉

7. What are the most important features as an administrator?

*It would be great to have such a system to enable creating new semesters, automatically updating the pages, having a way to upload the proposals and move away from the FTP and text editors.*

8. What level of oversight would you want for research submissions? Do you want direct control, or would you prefer a submission-approval method?

*If we are talking about the proposals from the community: Submission approval is the way to go (with interaction with the submitters)for us because we have multiple rounds of polishing and adjusting to have a final version of the proposals aligned with our goals (it is an iterative and incremental approach).*

#### Results

### Interview 4

B.S. Data Science student

2/1/2025

1. Can you describe your experience with student research in the Mathematics & Statistics department?

*I'm currently in my capstone but I haven't done much with student research.*

2. How do you currently access or showcase research projects and presentations?

*As far as I'm aware, the projects are mainly going to be presented as posters, though a digital version will be needed to produce those. I don't think there's any place to look at them aside from the ones that are posted in the hall.*

3. What difficulties do you face when finding past research or colloquia?

*I could maybe find them if I were to go through all the UGrads projects but they aren't really organized at all.*

4. If a research showcase website existed, how likely would you be to use it? Why or why not?

*It would be nice to be able to take inspiration from the past projects. When trying to come up with ideas for my own project, I was kind of at a loss for the scope I should be thinking about or the type of projects that work well. I would very likely use it once or twice.*

5. What features would be most valuable to you?

*Being able to search through project more easily would be nice.*

6. Have you ever tried to showcase your research online? If so, where?

*I have not.*

7. Would you want a dedicated portfolio for your research projects? Why or why not?

*I would but I would probably want it to be something that I had control over. Like hosting my projects on GitHub or the like.*

8. What would make submitting your research to a public repository easy or difficult?

*If I could just send it to the admin of the site for review, that would be best. Just getting email responses or the like for updates or changes. Having a dedicated page to submit through.*

9. Would this help when applying for jobs, internships, or graduate school?

*Yeah, having my work featured in an official location that I could reference would definitely help build my CV.*

### **Interview 5**

**Dr. Roy St. Laurant (Department Chair, NAU Mathematics & Statistics Department)**

1. How does the department track and archive student capstone research and other student-led projects?

*To be honest, we don’t have a formal system in place. Some faculty keep records of the projects they advise, but there’s no centralized archive. If students want to look at past capstone work, they typically have to ask a professor who might have kept a copy. For colloquia, we keep a list of past talks, but it’s mostly informal.*

2. Are there any existing tools or systems for this?

*Not really. Some students upload their work to ResearchGate or personal websites, but that’s inconsistent. The department’s website isn’t really built for hosting research.*

3. Do faculty or students ever ask you for past project examples?

*Yes, all the time. Students often want to see previous capstones for reference. Faculty sometimes want to showcase successful projects, but there’s no easy way to access them.*

4. What are the most significant challenges faculty and students face when trying to showcase or access past research?

*For students, I’d say visibility is the main issue. After completing a capstone or research project, it often goes unnoticed. That’s frustrating because many of these projects are quite impressive. Faculty, on the other hand, struggle to keep track of quality student work. We frequently see excellent projects, but we lack a systematic way to document them.*

5. Are there any issues with how colloquia presentations are archived?

*Yes. We keep a simple list of past colloquia, but there’s no repository for slides or videos. If a student misses a talk, there’s no easy way to access the content.*

6. Would faculty be willing to review and approve research submissions before they go public?

*I think so, but we’d want to keep it lightweight. Maybe it is just an option for faculty advisors to verify that a submission is appropriate before it’s published. We don’t want to add too much administrative burden.*

7. Have students ever expressed frustration about not having a good way to showcase their research?

*Yes, particularly those applying to grad school. They want a way to point to their work, but there's no standard process unless they upload it somewhere.*

8. Would a structured platform help with job applications and graduate school admissions?

*Absolutely. Being able to showcase research in a professional way would be very beneficial for students.*

9. Would a platform exist where students could submit and showcase their capstone projects, undergraduate research, and colloquium talks? If so, would that be valuable for the department?

*Yes, but only if it’s easy to use. If it requires too much maintenance or effort on our part, it might be challenging to sustain.*

10. What features would be most important?

*Searchability is key. If we can search by student, faculty advisor, or topic, that would be a game-changer. Also, it needs to be simple for students to upload their work.*

11. Would this be useful for attracting prospective students or external collaborators?

*Yes, particularly for graduate program recruitment. Showing strong undergraduate research could help us attract better students.*

12. Do you think external audiences, such as graduate schools or employers, actively seek out student research when evaluating candidates?

*For graduate schools, absolutely. Many programs prefer research experience. Employers? Perhaps not as much, unless it’s for a technical position, but having an organized repository wouldn’t hurt.*

13. What would make this platform useful for external audiences?

*Clear filtering options. Maybe a way to showcase particularly strong projects or highlight award-winning research.*

14. Would there be any privacy concerns with making student research public?

*We’d need an option for students to opt-out or restrict access. Some projects might contain sensitive data or unpublished work.*

15. This has been incredibly helpful—thank you for your insights! Based on your feedback, we’ll refine our project to ensure it remains valuable and user-friendly. Would you be willing to review a prototype in the future?

*Yes, I’d be happy to. Keep it simple and practical; faculty don’t have time to manage something too complex.*

16. Is there anything else we should consider?

*Think about sustainability. Who will maintain it long-term? If this is going to last, the department needs to be able to manage it without too much effort.*

17. That’s a great point. We’ll certainly consider that during our design. Thank you for your time!
